# This GitHub Actions workflow runs on manual trigger on a branch of a
# repository, and configures the React app in the AWS Amplify Console.
#
# First, the GitHub Action deploys the 'stack.yaml' AWS CloudFormation stack
# to your AWS Account. This stack configures the React app in the AWS Amplify Console.
#
# Then, you need to trigger a first build in the AWS Amplify Console to
# fully configure it.
